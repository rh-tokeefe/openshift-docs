= About adding Operators to a cluster

Using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), cluster administrators can install OLM-based Operators to an {ocp-product-title} cluster.

As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator by using the OperatorHub or the software catalog, depending on which {ocp-product-title} version is installed.
