{ols-official} 1.0.7 fixes the following issues:

* Previously, an invalid model reference in the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR) caused the {ols-long} installation to fail. Now, the `OLSConfig` CR health check ensures that the model exists before use, providing error details in the console. This results in improved server health checks, providing more precise status information to the web console, improving the user experience. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1949[OLS-1949]
